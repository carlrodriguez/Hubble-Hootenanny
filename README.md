# Hubble-Hootenanny
Carl tries to be a cosmologist, part 1.

Except it didn't work...making the repository public since it has some nice features/utilities for computing waveforms, detectabilitiy of binaries, Fisher matricies, etc.

Note that the Pandas table of Kerr QNMs from Berti's website is too big to store in git.  Instead, use the function build_kerr_qnm_table from fisher_matrix.py to construct it, after you've downloaded all the relevant QNM coefficients from https://pages.jh.edu/~eberti2/ringdown/ (it's designed to use QNMs l=2-7 for the S=-2 case)
